# Graduate Admission Predictor

This is a Flask app for students applying for a Masters level
course to universities in USA. It predicts how confident you 
should be of your application based on the confidence and 
credentials of your peers.

## Motivation

Originally a kaggle task to acquire the lowest RMSE, I decided to
build on my end to end project making skills and create a flask 
app with the data.


## Demo

## Installation

To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.
